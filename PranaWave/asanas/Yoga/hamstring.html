        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Hamstrings</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Beginner</p>
        <p class="para1">There's a lot going on in Heron Pose (Krounchasana), which helps open all the major muscle groups in your legs. Don't be daunted because there are also a lot of ways to modify the full position so that it's more accessible. The main stretch here is in the hamstrings, so warming them up first is a good idea. You can use this pose as part of a core and abs sequence or one with a focus on the hamstrings or opening the hips.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            This pose stretches the hamstring and calf on the extended leg and the quadriceps on the bent leg. You can get tight leg muscles from participating in a variety of physical activities, including running, cycling, soccer, and basketball. Keeping flexible can help you with sports performance and ease of motion in daily life.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Begin seated in Staff Pose (Dandasana) with both legs extended in front of you and the spine nice and straight. If you usually sit up on a blanket in staff pose to help elongate the spine, you can use a blanket for the same purpose throughout this pose.</li>
            <li>Fold your left leg back into a Half Hero Pose (Ardha Virasana) position. Your left foot should be outside your left hip, not under it. Take care to keep the left foot pointing straight back and the left knee hugging toward the midline. If Virasana is painful for your knees or doesn't work for you for some other reason, just keep your left leg forward instead, bending the left knee in a one-legged Sukasana.</li>
            <li>Bend your right knee and bring your right foot to the floor close to your right sit bone.</li>
            <li>Hold your right foot with both your hands and lift it off the floor.</li>
            <li>Lean your torso back slightly and anchor your shoulder blades onto your back and your arms into their shoulder sockets.</li>
            <li>Slowly straighten your right leg as much as you can. Keep your spine long and your shoulders down. Don't hunch forward in an attempt straighten your leg more. Your extended leg and your torso should make a narrow V shape.</li>
            <li>Hold for about five breaths and then release and set up for the other side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Rounding Back</h4>
        <p class="para1">The most common mistake is to let the spine curve forward. It's important to keep the spine nice and straight.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Hunching Shoulders</h4>
        <p class="para1">Your shoulders should be kept back so your chest is open for good breathing, as well as to help prevent rounding the back. Adjust where you grasp the upraised leg to prevent this.</p>

        <img src="https://newtownathletic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Svarga-Dvijasana-Yoga-Pose.jpg" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Svarga Dvidasana</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Leg strength, balance</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Intermediate</p>
        <p class="para1">Bird of Paradise Pose (Svarga Dvijasana) looks challenging. There is a lot going on in this pose with the bind, standing on one leg, and the hamstring stretch. It starts to make a lot more sense when you break it down step by step. You must be able to do a Bound Extended Side Angle Pose (Baddha Utthita Parsvakonasana) before you can tackle Bird of Paradise. If you can manage the bind with a strap, an open chest, and a smile, feel free to go ahead and try to take on the transition to standing in Svarga Dvijasana incorporating your strap. But if you're still working on the bind, don't be in a rush to move on. This pose will still be here when you're ready for it.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            This pose strengthens the legs and core. It stretches the arms and opens the hips and hamstrings. It also improves balance. It's not a position you will often find yourself in daily life, but you will be more ready to meet any balance challenges that come your way. Traditionally, it is said to open the sacral chakra and the root chakra.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Turn your head so that your gaze comes to your front foot.</li>
            <li>Step your back foot forward so that your feet are parallel to the front of your mat. Keep the bind while you do this. It's OK if it takes you a few steps to get the back foot forward. Now you're in a forward bend with your arms wrapped around one leg. Keep both knees slightly bent.</li>
            <li>Transfer your weight to your free leg (the unbound one). Stand firmly on that foot.</li>
            <li>Lift your other foot off the ground. Slowly bring yourself up to standing, keeping the bind and therefore lifting the bound leg up with you.</li>
            <li>When you feel steady in a standing position, begin to straighten the bound leg any amount. Bring your gaze over your opposite shoulder, away from your outstretched leg.</li>
            <li>To come out, rebend the bound leg and slowly lower that foot to the floor. Keep the bind as you step your free leg to the back of the mat, reversing the process you used to come into the pose. You'll end up back in Bound Side Angle Pose.</li>
            <li>Release the bind and repeat on the other side.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Attempting It Too Soon</h4>
        <p class="para1">As an intermediate pose, you must be familiar with basic poses and especially those that lead up to this pose before you attempt it.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Hunching Shoulders</h4>
        <p class="para1">Your shoulders should be pulled back, never hunched.</p>

        <h2 class="heading3">Monkey Pose (Hanumanasana)</h2>
        <img src="https://www.theyogacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Full.-Splits-Hanumanasana-1200x800.jpeg" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : The splits</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Hamstrings, hips, groin</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Advanced</p>
        <p class="para1">Monkey Pose (Hanumanasana) is an intense stretch commonly referred to as the splits. In yoga, Monkey Pose is done with closed hips, while in gymnastics and cheerleading, splits are done with open hips. This alignment is subtle, but significantly different.

            The ideology behind this pose is to take a leap of faith and be devoted to others. Its name comes from the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman, who rescued Sita, the wife of the deity Rama. Sita was being held on the island of Sri Lanka, so Hanuman had to take a huge step across the straits in order the reach her.
            
            This giant step is interpreted as the splits in this pose. Yoga teachers often like to tell this story while you are holding Monkey Pose for what seems like an eternity, which is a lesson in patience. It is often preceded by Low Lunge Pose and followed by Seated Forward Bend.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            Monkey Pose stretches the hamstrings, groin muscles, and hip flexors. You will also feel a quadriceps stretch in the back-facing leg. If you enjoy cardio exercises such as running, cycling, and skiing, this will help you maintain flexibility for those activities.

Research also shows that a yoga sequence containing Monkey Pose can help you improve your muscle strength, muscle endurance, flexibility, and agility. These benefits were reported after doing eight weeks of a consistent yoga practice.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Come to a kneeling position with your thighs perpendicular to the floor. </li>
            <li>Exhale as you lower your hands to the floor in front of your knees, "tenting" them so you are up on your fingertips.</li>
            <li>Bring your right leg straight out in front of you, the heel on the floor. Flex your right foot strongly.</li>
            <li>Begin to slide your right foot forward, keeping your right leg straight, as you also extend the left leg as straight as possible behind you. It helps to bring your right heel off your mat so that it slides more easily.</li>
            <li>Keep your hips facing forward. The toes of the left foot can be tucked under or you can release the top of that foot to the floor.</li>
            <li>Hold the pose for five to 10 breaths and then repeat on the other side.</li>
            <li>To come out of Monkey Pose, bend your right leg, come onto your left knee, and draw your right leg back toward your body.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <p class="para1">For this pose, the key thing to understand is the open versus closed position of the hips. In Monkey Pose's closed-hip position, both hip points are lined up in the same plane and facing the front of the mat. Sometimes it helps to think of the hip points as headlights on a car; you want both headlights facing forward.

            In yoga, the way that you go about getting into the pose or position is always more important than the final result. If you can get your legs flat on the floor but your alignment is off, reassess your positioning. It may help to have an instructor guide you in doing this pose correctly.</p>
