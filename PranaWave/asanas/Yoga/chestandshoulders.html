        <p class="para1">Poses to open your chest and heart center you. Since yoga's approach is holistic, there is some overlap between backbends and shoulder stretches. Shoulder stretches release tension, which helps prevent pain in the back and neck. Since the shoulders can be vulnerable to injury, especially as you age, don't overdo it.</p>

        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Stretch for the gluteus, chest, and obliques</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Beginner</p>
        <p class="para1">It feels good to do twists like the Supine Spinal Twist (Supta Matsyendrasana) during the cool down portion of your yoga session. At the end of your practice, you can take advantage of your warmed muscles to move into deep twists that help counteract the effects of too much time spent sitting in chairs. As an experiment, try this pose when you first get on your mat and again at the end of your practice and see if you feel a difference.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            Supta Matsyendrasana stretches the glutes, chest, and obliques. Because of the chest stretch, it is considered a heart opener. It improves spinal mobility and can aid digestion. It is a relaxing pose at the end of a yoga session. In everyday life, your posture will benefit from this antidote to sitting and hunching over work.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Lie down on your back.</li>
            <li>Bend your knees and put the soles of your feet on the floor with your knees pointing up toward the ceiling.</li>
            <li>Press into your feet to lift your hips slightly off the floor and shift them about an inch to your right. This is an important step because it sets your hips up to stack one on top of the other when you move into the twist.</li>
            <li>Exhale and draw your right knee into your chest and extend your left leg flat on the floor. Keep your left foot actively flexed throughout the pose. Inhale.</li>
            <li>Exhale and cross your right knee over your midline to the floor on the left side of your body. Your right hip is now stacked on top of your left hip. You can hook your right foot behind your left knee if you like.</li>
            <li>Open your right arm to the right, keeping it in line with your shoulders. Rest your left hand on your right knee or extend it to make a T shape with the arms. Turn your palms toward the ceiling.</li>
            <li>Turn your head to the right, bringing your gaze over your shoulder to your right fingertips. You can skip this step if it doesn't feel good on your neck.</li>
            <li>On your exhalations, release your left knee and your right shoulder toward the floor.</li>
            <li>Hold the pose for five to 10 breaths. To come out of the pose, inhale and roll onto your back, drawing your right knee into your chest. Release both legs to the floor to neutralize your spine for several breaths before doing the other side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Holding the Breath</h4>
        <p class="para1">You should breathe deeply and smoothly throughout this pose. Do not hold your breath.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Forcing Knee to the Floor</h4>
        <p class="para1">Do not force your knee to the floor. If reaching the floor does not feel accessible, bring your knee over only as much as you can comfortably. You might place a pillow under your knees and feet.</p>

        <h2 class="heading3">Bow Pose (Dhanurasana)</h2>
        <img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-92053061,width-640,resizemode-4,imgsize-26882/bow-pose-dhanurasana.jpg" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Dhanurasana</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Chest and back</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Intermediate</p>
        <p class="para1">Bow Pose (Dhanurasana) is an intermediate yoga pose similar to a backbend. Itâ€™s one of the 12 basic Hatha Yoga poses. By lifting your torso up and backward, the chest is opened and the back is deeply stretched. This pose is a great way to deeply stretch the back after a long day of hunching over.

            This yoga pose can be performed as part of your regular practice or within a sequence of back stretches. After your body is warmed up from some standing and floor poses, perform Bow Pose. This pose can also be used as preparation for a deeper backbend stretch. A final relaxation pose follows nicely.
            
            To get started, grab your yoga mat. If you are a beginner, you may also use a yoga towel or yoga straps to support you into the stretch.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            Bow Pose primarily benefits the chest and back. It's natural for the body to bend backward, but this is rarely a position we find ourselves in.

Bow Pose can be used to open up the chest and stretch out the back, which is especially beneficial for people who sit or stand for long periods of time.

This yoga pose also opens up the neck, shoulders, and abdomen. It improves flexibility in the back and encourages balance in the core and chest.

If you have a stiff back, Bow Pose may be beneficial. For people with a desk job, Bow Pose can help improve posture and alleviate the discomfort that slouching may cause.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Lie flat on your stomach. Keep your chin on the mat and your hands at your sides. Your hands should be palm up.</li>
            <li>Exhale while you bend your knees. Bring your heels as close as you can to your buttocks. Your knees should be hip-width apart.</li>
            <li>Lift your hands and take hold of your ankles. Be sure to grab the ankle and not the top part of the feet. Your fingers should wrap around the ankles, but your thumb does not. Keep your toes pointed.</li>
            <li>Inhale and lift the heels away from the buttocks, keeping a hold of your ankles. Simultaneously, lift your head, chest, and thighs away from the mat. As you lift, rotate your shoulders safely and comfortably. At this point, only your core should touch the mat, while the rest of your body is lifted towards the ceiling.</li>
            <li>Draw your tailbone into the mat to deepen the stretch. You should feel the stretch in your back as the weight and balance shifts to your core. Your chest and shoulders should feel open.</li>
            <li>Look straight ahead and hold the pose for about 15 seconds while you focus on stretching, breathing, and balancing.</li>
            <li>Exhale and release the pose. Lower your head, chest, thighs, and feet back towards the mat. Let go of your ankles and return to your hands to your side. Relax for a few seconds and repeat the pose as needed or continue to your next pose.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Don't Hold the Tops of Your Feet</h4>
        <p class="para1">When you reach back with your hands, grab your ankles and not any other part of the foot. The ankle is the most secure part of the foot, whereas grabbing the top of the feet may lead to slipping. If your hands slip, you may lose balance and hit your chin or chest on the floor.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Keep Your Knees Hip-width</h4>
        <p class="para1">The width of your knees is an important part of Bow Pose proper form. When your knees are too close together, this may lead to discomfort in the back. It can also open up the hips incorrectly and lead to straining. Keeping your knees hip-width apart helps the body to align safely and comfortably.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Rotate the Shoulder Socket Carefully</h4>
        <p class="para1">Bow Pose requires you to reach your arm back and then lift. Make sure you rotate your shoulder slowly and carefully through the movement. Rushing through the reaching and lifting of your arms can injure your shoulder or cause discomfort.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Release the Pose Safely</h4>
        <p class="para1">Entering and exiting Bow Pose can be tough for beginners and people with limited flexibility. Releasing the pose safely is vital to prevent injury and straining. Be sure to release the pose once youâ€™ve lowered your head, chest, thighs, and feet. Releasing the pose when these body parts are lifted can cause a painful impact on the floor. Lower yourself slowly and then release your ankles when you can do so safely.
            </p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Don't Hold Your Breath</h4>
        <p class="para1">In some yoga poses, holding your breath is part of the stretch and can be beneficial. Bow Pose does not require you to hold your breath. Follow the correct breathing pattern to benefit from this pose. Exhale as you bend into and out of the pose. Inhale when you lift up. Holding your breath may restrict the chest from opening up.</p>

        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Advanced</p>
        <p class="para1">Wild Thing Pose is a newer addition to the yoga canon, having been introduced and widely taught in Anusara Yoga. The pose has evolved to being taught in a much more flexible way that fits more practices and body types. This version, which is sometimes called Flipping Your Dog, calls for keeping both legs bent to carry your weight more equally and for keeping the supporting arm more perpendicular to the floor. In yoga classes, Flipping Your Dog is completely optional. There is a lot of room for interpretation in this pose so do what makes sense for your body, including bypassing it altogether.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            This pose improves spinal mobility and strengthens the arms. It opens the hips and stretches the hip flexors and thighs. It's meant to be a joyous pose to express positive emotion, and as such it might help break you out of the blues. It is said to stimulate the heart chakra.</p>

            <li>As the hips come to face the ceiling, bring the right foot to the floor on the outside of your left foot. Your right foot will land off your mat.</li>
            <li>The right arm lifts off the floor and stretches toward the front of the room.</li>
            <li>To come out, pivot on the ball of the left foot to return the toes to face the front of the room and drop the right arm to return to Down Dog Split.</li>
            <li>Repeat on the other side.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <p class="para1">The biggest error to avoid is doing this pose if you are a beginner or you feel any discomfort in the pose. As it is a deep backbend you can risk injury if you are not suitably advanced and flexible.</p>
