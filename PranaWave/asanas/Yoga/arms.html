        <p class="para1">Poses in which your arms bear most of your body weight are great for improving arm strength, along with a few chaturanga push-ups, of course. Yoga poses for arms include:</p>

        <img src="https://media.yogauonline.com/app/uploads/2021/11/06032213/0_how_to_practice_upward-facing_dog_pose_or_urdhva_mukha_svanasana-1.webp" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Upward dog, up dog, forward facing dog</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Chest, shoulders, abdominals, triceps, forearms, low back</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Beginner</p>
        <p class="para1">Upward facing dog, often shortened to "upward dog" or "up dog," helps to stretch the chest and abdominal muscles while strengthening the shoulders, triceps, forearms, and low back.

            Upward facing dog is usually done as part of the sun salutation sequence of poses when you go through your vinyasa flow. The sequence typically moves from chaturanga to upward facing dog to downward facing dog. Like chaturanga, upward dog is often seen as a transitional posture. It's important, though, not to rush through it without taking time to establish the pose correctly. If you do, you won't get the most out of the movement. Also, over time, repetitive practice with bad alignment can lead to wear and tear (and injury) in the shoulders.
            
            In its most full expression, upward dog is a backbend with the hips, thighs, and knees suspended off the ground, and only the palms and tops of the feet (and maybe the shins) supporting the body's weight. The palms should be aligned under the shoulders, the shoulder blades engaged and pulling the shoulders down and away from the ears, the chest open, and the eyes looking forward.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            This strong backbend helps stretch the abdominals, chest, and shoulders while strengthening the arms and the posterior chain of the body, particularly the spinal erectors that help with maintaining good posture. Most of us spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, with our shoulders rolled forward, neck tilted down, and generally slumped without much engagement of the abs or low back. This pose can help reset good posture and encourage proper alignment. Proper alignment and good posture can help reduce the incidence of low back pain. Plus, stretching and opening the chest and shoulders just feels good.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Move from chaturanga dandasana, exhaling as you lower yourself slowly toward the ground from a plank position. As your body approaches the ground, inhale to straighten your arms as you roll over your toes, changing your foot position from toes tucked under to resting on the tops of your feet. If you can't roll over your toes, it's fine to flip them one at a time. Don't bring your thighs to the floor during the transition if you can help it.</li>
            <li>Open your chest toward the ceiling as you straighten your arms. Your gaze will go up slightly, but it's not necessary to throw your head back.</li>
            <li>Keep your legs engaged and drop your hips toward the floor. The only things touching the floor are the palms of your hands and the tops of your feet. Push strongly into both.</li>
            <li>Keep your shoulders over your wrists and draw your shoulder blades down and toward your spine to create space between your shoulders and your ears.</li>
            <li>Exhale and roll back over your toes to plant the balls of your feet before lifting your hips to downward facing dog.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Hunching Your Shoulders to Your Ears</h4>
        <p class="para1">It's easy to allow your shoulders and back to disengage during upward dog. You'll notice this when your neck collapses down between your shoulders, and your shoulders end up close to your ears. Work to actively draw your shoulder blades down and in toward your spine, pulling your shoulders away from your ears. This helps improve posture and proper alignment.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Disengaging Your Thighs</h4>
        <p class="para1">You want your entire body, from your feet to your neck, to be engaged during upward dog. This helps maintain proper alignment while protecting your lower back. If your legs are slouched into the ground, you're not maximizing the benefits of the pose. Hug your thighs together, press firmly through the tops of your feet and your palms, and actively lift your thighs away from the mat.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Craning Your Neck to Look Up</h4>
        <p class="para1">Your neck should remain comfortably aligned with your spine, creating a nice half-U curve from the base of your spine to your neck. If you're looking up at the ceiling, you're craning your neck too far. Look straight forward, so your ears are aligned with your shoulders.</p>

        <h2 class="heading3">Flying Crow Pose (Eka Pada Galavasana)</h2>
        <img src="https://www.theyogacollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flying-pigeon-2-e1586542489617.jpg" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Flying Pigeon, One-Legged Balance</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Arms, core, hips</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Intermediate</p>
        <p class="para1">Flying Crow Pose (Eka Pada Galavasana) is a great yoga pose for increasing arm and core strength, opening your hips, and improving balance. It is not a beginner pose, though—you'll need some solid yoga practice, strength, and balance to do this pose safely and effectively.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">Once you've mastered it, Flying Crow is one of the most elegant and impressive moves in yoga practice. It also boasts many benefits for your core, arms, hips, balance, and mental focus.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Begin standing with your knees bent in Awkward Chair (Utkatasana)</li>
            <li>Inhale as you bring your hands to Anjali Mudra at your heart.</li>
            <li>Exhale as you shift your weight to your left foot.</li>
            <li>Inhale and lift your right foot off the ground.</li>
            <li>Keeping both knees bent, exhale as you cross your right ankle over your left thigh, resting the ankle just above your left knee.</li>
            <li>Inhale as you begin to come into a forward bend over your right shin. Make sure you bend your left leg enough to bring your palms flat to the floor.</li>
            <li>Exhale. Hook the toes of your right foot around your upper left arm. Keep your right foot strongly flexed and your toes tightly hugging the arm.</li>
            <li>Bend both elbows to come into Chaturanga arms, which will make a shelf for your right shin.</li>
            <li>Inhale as you lean your torso forward, resting your right shin on your upper arms.</li>
            <li>Exhale and lift your left foot off the floor, keeping your knee bent at first.</li>
            <li>Inhale and focus on bringing more weight forward as you straighten your left leg behind you. Your left foot should remain off the floor the whole time.</li>
            <li>Exhale and flex your left foot strongly as you continue to hug the right foot to your upper arm.</li>
            <li>Breathe into the pose for a moment.</li>
            <li>To release from the pose, draw your left foot back to the front of your mat in a slow, controlled movement. From there, reverse your path to get into the pose by moving back through Utkatasana until you're standing.</li>
            <li>When you are ready, repeat on the other side.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">You Haven't Mastered Tree Pose/Half Lotus</h4>
        <p class="para1">To do most standing balancing poses properly, you really need to be confident in Tree Pose–especially the Half Lotus variation.

            If you are still early on in your yoga practice, don't rush through getting to know your standing poses. Achieving the strength, focus, and core stability you'll need to balance in Tree Pose (usually one of the first balancing poses you learn in class) comes with time. Once you've mastered it, you'll be able to get the full benefit of other standing poses</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">You're Forgetting to Breathe</h4>
        <p class="para1">Forgetting to breathe is one of the biggest mistakes people make in their yoga practice. With any exercise, you need to ensure your muscles are getting adequate oxygen for optimal performance and safety, but with yoga specifically, failing to focus on your breathing means you'll miss key benefits of the practice.

            If you catch yourself holding your breath at any point in your practice, pause and refocus. If you're unsure about where to breath or tend to lose track, ask your yoga instructor to show you some breathing awareness exercises.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">You Aren't Warmed Up</h4>
        <p class="para1">As one of the more advanced and demanding yoga poses, not just physically but mentally, you don't want to go into Flying Crow without a proper warm-up. Try starting with a few Sun Salutations, then move on to poses that will open your hips and ground your feet, like Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I).</p>

        <h2 class="heading3">Firefly Pose (Tittibhasana)</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.yogajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Firefly-Mod-1_Andrew-Clark_1.jpg" alt="Downward Facing Dog" class="img">
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Core, shoulders, arms</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Advanced</p>
        <p class="para1">Firefly Pose is an advanced arm balance. It relies on core strength and having great flexibility in the hip flexors and hamstrings, as well as strong arms and shoulders. For the intermediate to advanced student who has learned other arm balances, this one is actually easier than it looks.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">This pose strengthens the wrists, forearms, shoulders, triceps, hip flexors, and core. It provides a stretch for the hamstrings, adductors, and outer hips. Practicing it will help improve your sense of balance. Traditionally, it is said to provide relief from stress.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Take your feet about 18 inches apart (this will vary a bit based on your size). Come into a forward bend with your knees slightly bent.</li>
            <li>Nestle your shoulders as far under your knees as you can. You can bend your knees more if you need too. It's OK if you can't get your knees all the way onto your shoulders. The thighs on the upper arms will do. </li>
            <li>Bring your palms flat on the floor just behind your feet.</li>
            <li>Bend your elbows slightly back as you would if you were heading into Chaturanga Dandasana. Don't bring the upper arms all the way to parallel with the floor, however.</li>
            <li>Begin to shift your weight back to rest on your upper arms. Let that slight backward momentum lift your feet up off the floor.</li>
            <li>Straighten your arms as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Straighten your legs and hug your upper arms strongly with your thighs.</li>
            <li>Flex your feet.</li>
            <li>To come out, bend your knees and tip your feet forward until they touch the floor again. (Or just sit down on your butt.)</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Not Warmed Up</h4>
        <p class="para1">Be sure that you do a thorough warmup before you attempt this pose. Stretching and using cold muscles might contribute to strain or injury.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Not Flexible or Strong Enough</h4>
        <p class="para1">Even with a suitable warmup, you may not yet have reached the level of flexibility and strength needed for this pose. Continue to practice poses that strengthen your core, shoulders, and arms.</p>
