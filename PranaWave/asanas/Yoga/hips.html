        <p class="para1">A new way of thinking about hip stretches encompasses not only hip openers but poses to
            strengthen and stretch the entire pelvic region. Yoga poses for hips include:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                <strong>Beginner:</strong> Garland pose
            </li>

        <img src="https://www.gaia.com/wp-content/uploads/Meta-GAIA_CAVEMANCOLLECTIVE-190-squat-pose-1024x576.jpg"
            class="img" alt="Downward Facing Dog">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Squat</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Hips, groin muscles, ankles, quads</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Beginner</p>
        <p class="para1">Garland Pose (Malansana) is yoga's deep squat. It opens your hips and groin in counterbalance to the
            tightness you can develop from sitting too much. You can make use of props for support at first so you can
            do the pose in a way that's not painful. Then work over time to slowly wean yourself from the props by
            lowering them little by little. It can be a long process, but it works and is important for your long-term
            mobility and for pain prevention.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            Garland Pose opens the hips and groins as it stretches and strengthens the feet and ankles.

            While squatting comes naturally to children and is used as a resting position in many places on Earth, most
            adults in the First World have gotten out of the habit. So far out of the habit, in fact, that they find
            squatting extremely uncomfortable for their hips and feet. Garland pose is an effective way to counter the
            tightness you get from spending too much time sitting in chairs.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Come to stand with your feet about mat's width apart.</li>
            <li>Bend the knees and lower your butt toward the floor to come into a squat.</li>
            <li>It's natural for your toes to want to turn out and that's OK, but don't overdo it. Eventually, you're
                working toward keeping the feet closer to parallel.</li>
            <li>Take your upper arms inside your knees and bend the elbows to bring the palms together into anjali mudra
                (prayer position).</li>
            <li>With hands to your heart center in anjali mudra, see if you can allow your thumbs to touch your sternum
                as if to help keep the chest lifted. Continue pressing upper arms into thighs and thighs into upper arm
                to stay engaged.</li>
            <li>Keep your spine straight, your butt moving toward the floor, and your shoulders relaxed away from your
                ears.</li>
            <li>Stay here for five breaths, then straighten the legs to come out. You can come directly into a Forward
                Fold if you like.</li>
            <li>Try repeating the pose three times to take full advantage of getting warmed up. If you are practicing at
                home, it's fine to do some other poses in between your squats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <p class="para1">Some people might keep the hips above the knees and the weight too far forward (into the balls of the feet).
            This position does not allow your body to drop into the pose. Use a block or two to sit on if this is an
            issue.

            Your heels may come up when you squat. To keep a better balance, place a folded blanket under your heels for
            support. Otherwise, the pose will place more pressure forward rather than down.</p>

        <h1 class="heading2">Intermediate</h1>
        <h2 class="heading3">Reclined Goddess Pose (Supta Baddha Konasana)</h2>
        <img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/f5c42-16549270972289-1920.jpg?w=840" class="img"
            alt="Downward Facing Dog">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Reclined Bound Angle Pose, Reclined Butterfly Pose</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Restorative, hip opener</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Intermediate</p>
        <p class="para1">Reclined Goddess Pose is relaxing pose that is also a hip opener. As a restorative pose, you should be as
            supported and comfortable as possible. The goal is to stay in the pose for 10 minutes while gravity works to
            deepen your stretch as you clear your mind. You can use this pose at the end of a yoga session, or in the
            morning or evening to begin or end your day.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            This pose relaxes and quiets the mind. It opens the groins and hips. The group of muscles called the hip
            flexors get tight when you spend a lot of time sitting. Stretching them can help relieve and prevent back
            pain and sciatica.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>Come to lie on your back.</li>
            <li>Bend your knees, keeping the soles of your feet on the floor.</li>
            <li>Open your knees out to either side, bringing the soles of your feet together. The legs will be in the
                same position as they are in Cobbler's Pose (Baddha Konasana).</li>
            <li>Your arms can be in any comfortable position—out in a T shape, overhead, relaxed by your sides or
                resting on your thighs are some options.</li>
            <li>Stay here several minutes as gravity works to deepen your stretch. Breathe naturally throughout the
                pose.</li>
            <li>To come out, reach down and help your knees come back together. Then roll over to one side and use your
                hands to support you as you sit up.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Arching Lower Back</h4>
        <p class="para1">If you find that you are arching your lower back, lying on a bolster can correct this.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Aches and Pains</h4>
        <p class="para1">As the pose deepens, you may have aches and pains in your groin, hips, or knees. If you feel any pain or
            discomfort, come out of the pose since it won't benefit you to stay in it. Use props to avoid these
            distractions.</p>

        <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OLlF7oOy3FR3gE55h-lL5WKI36l9RMYUjqZOSH5SHtpVsYI8gh0Q_dOW6o6q-7SQNMUHNFR5Qa6vc7TPP1E8z7OzXvv_OdW3MBojjtjNaIJmLzZHY9F3OpvfQFWLvUeGjBRg1IgC"
            class="img" alt="Downward Facing Dog">
        <p class="list"><strong>Also Known As</strong> : Lotus Position</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Targets</strong> : Knees, ankles</p>
        <p class="list"><strong>Level</strong> : Advanced</p>
        <p class="para1">While Lotus Pose (Padmasana) is one of the most recognizable yoga poses, it is an advanced pose that isn't
            appropriate for the majority of practictioners. In part, this is because most Westerners have gotten out of
            the habit of squatting and sitting on the floor and therefore have limited hip mobility. The good news is
            that your hip mobility may improve over time with consistent practice, making Lotus possible.

        </p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Benefits</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            Lotus Pose opens your hips and stretches your knees and ankles. Traditionally, it is said to relieve
            menstrual pain and be good for sciatica. It is a calming pose that can be used for meditation once you have
            mastered it.</p>
        <h3 class="heading4">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
        <ul class="bsdk">
            <li>From Staff Pose, bend your right knee and use your hands to bring the right ankle to the left hip crease
                with the sole of the right foot facing upward. Settle the foot in the hip crease.</li>
            <li>Bend your left knee and use your hands to cross the left ankle over to the right hip crease with the
                sole of the left foot facing up.</li>
            <li>Sit up tall with a long spine and your shoulders moving away from your ears. Place hands on thighs,
                palms facing up with shoulders drawing back and down. Actively lengthen the crown of your head upwards.
            </li>
            <li>Relax your knees toward the floor.</li>
            <li>After 10 to 20 breaths, release the legs and repeat the posture with your left foot on the bottom and
                your right foot on top.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading4">Common Mistakes</h3>
        <h4 class="heading5">Not Having Enough Hip Flexibility</h4>
        <p class="para1">In order to get into full Lotus, the legs have to have the range of motion to externally rotate out from the
            pelvis. Forcing the legs into position will actually not have the effect of opening the hips but will
            instead transfer the strain down the leg to the knee joint, which is more likely to give.

            As you can imagine, this is not a great scenario for the knees. Raising the seat by sitting up on a blanket
            helps position the hips, but it's not going to create the necessary mobility if it's not there. Instead, you
            will need to work your way up to full Lotus by doing Half Lotus and other hip-openers.</p>
        <h4 class="heading5">Thinking It's Essential for Meditation</h4>
        <p class="para1">Despite the prevailing idea that Lotus is the preferred pose for meditation, that practice really doesn't
            depend at all on the position in which you sit as long as it is comfortable.

            Alternatives include Half Lotus, Hero Pose, or Easy Pose. You can even meditate while sitting in a chair if
            that's the position that encourages ease in the body.
